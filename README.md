 Machine Learning Model Deployment with Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning workflow**, starting from data analysis and model training to deploying the trained model using **Streamlit** as a web application.

The main objective of this project is to showcase how a machine learning model can be trained, evaluated, saved, and finally deployed as an interactive web application.
